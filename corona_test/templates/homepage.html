                    Coronaviruses are actually a large family of viruses, but the common one (COVID-19) that has recently 
                    gone viral in early 2020 has not been identified in humans before.

                    In short, this virus is a member of the large coronavirus family which came from animals. 
                    Several coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. 
                    Morever, this virus is zoonotic, which means they can be transmitted between animals and people.

                    “Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. 
                    In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.”
